State-Space Measurement of Australian GDP Growth: Estimated using Rstan

RBA RDP: http://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2014/pdf/rdp2014-12.pdf
We use state-space methods to construct new estimates of Australian gross
domestic product (GDP) growth from the published national accounts estimates
of expenditure, income and production. Across a range of specifications, our
measures are substantially less volatile than headline GDP growth. We conclude
that much of the quarter-to-quarter volatility in Australian GDP growth reflects
measurement error rather than true shifts in the level of economic activity
